    <h1>What is Tool Tracking - Sensor Fusion of Vision and Kinematics</h1>
    <p>Tool tracking is about real-time locating precisely where are the surgical instruments in the surgical field during surgery.
      It is an old topic, even back then, for surgical robotics with many potential applications such as collision avoidance when
      instruments are not within the field of view or hidden beneath the tissues. If accurate enough, it could even become
      a handy measurement tool.
    </p>

    <p>For surgical robotics application, tool tracking presented both a challenge and an opportunity. The challenge is to reliablly
      locate the instrument with good accuracy in a complex and dynamic surgical field. The opportunity is the availability of
      the precise robotic kinematics that could be biased. Hence, an efficient sensor fusion mechanism like extended Kalman Filter
      can be applied to correct the kinematics biases in real-time based on vision observation. The vision observation is 3D location of the tracked
      instrument based on matching its left and right views and the endoscopic stereo camera calibration.</p>

    <!-- The System Evaluation Approach  -->
    <h2>System Evaulation - Performance Evaluation and Clinical Labs</h2>
    <p>One big challenge to push technology advancement into medicine, including surgery, is to prove that the proposed technology is 1) firstly safe, and
      2) secondly, effective for the proposed objectives.</p>

    <p>For tool tracking development, even just a technical development, we went through objective evaulation of its performance with dry labs
    and clinical labs with surgeons. For the objective performance evaluation in real-time, we built an efficient pipeline with NDI's 6-DOF optical
    tracker sevring as the ground-truth tracker.

    <!-- Tool Tracking Enabled Potential Applications -->
    <h2>Tool Tracking - Potential Applications </h2>
    <p>As mentioned, tool tracking (TT) has many potential applications. Please note potential applications wont become actual until FDA approval.
      In this project, we focused on technical capability in realistic surgical environment, but not meant for FDA submission.
      The following image shows an interesting potential application as measurement tool.
