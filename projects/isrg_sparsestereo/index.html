        Every computer vision research knew the classic problem of estimating depth via matching the left and right
        images of the scene in the field of view.
        It was interesting because it was not a solved problem in many applications where plenty changes exist such as occlusion,
        shinning surface, smooth surface in the scene. So it was quite a accomplishment that we were able to brought a working stereo
        to clinical labs for surgeons to try it out. The stereo ran at 1-5 fps based on a NVIDIA Geoforce GPU (early days of GPU for AI).
        As you can see from picture here, the full-resolution result was quite solid.

    <p>Then I heard something that shocked me from the physician who was using the system: "This is cool. What do I do
      with the stereo or depth info, Wenyi?" An exceptional surgeon, she was at the forefront of her field, dedicated
      to teaching surgeon fellows and collaborating with engineers like me to push the boundaries of surgical robotics.
      This was the beginning of me always asking why before digging into how!
    </p>

    <p>Further collaborations with surgeons resulted in a real application that I will describe later.
      From a technical point of view, it boils down to robust stereo matching of surgical field (tissue) at
      selected points or regions of interest to surgeos. In other words, robust sparse stereo is a desired
      foundation technique. Without getting into all the details, it is suffice to say that we had a robust
      solution that was tested in clinical labs even when the selected points/regions are featureless.

    <!-- 3D Telestration Motivating Sparse Stereo  -->
    <h2>Clinical Motivation - 3D Telestration</h2>
    <p>The clincal motivation for sparse stereo comes from 3D telestration. Telestration is a must-have tool
      when a master surgeon to train a surgeon fellow live in surgery. The master surgeon could be remote,
      sitting in front of a computer, watching the video feed of the surgical field operated by the surgeon
      fellow. Often the master surgeon would draw an arrow on top of a point of interest, on the 2D screen, to
      ask the surgeon fellow to cut tissue, for example. Interestingly, the surgeon fellow is seeing a 3D view of
      the surgical field, rather then the 2D view (say, right view) for the master surgeon. To properly
      display the point of interest to daVinci robot's 3D surgeon console, we need to locate the corresponding
      point on the left view, a classical sparse stereo problem.

    <!-- Other Applications of Sparse Sterep -->
    <h2>Sparse Stereo - Potential Applications </h2>
    <p>There are several potential applications for robust sparse stereo. For examle, automating optimal
      vision setting was a big deal. This was early 2000's when a stereoscopic endoscope still consisted of a CCD camera head
      coupled with the scope. It produced video with great image quality, but its depth of camera was quite limited.
      As a result, manual camera focus was often required once you moved the camera too far or too close for good
      reasons.

    </div>

    <p>One interesting application is that sparse stereo could enable a surgical robot for micro-surgery
      from the perception point of view. The key characteristics of a micro-surgery is that its working distance
      (<2cm) is much shorter than the normal robotic surgery (5 to 20cm). So when you piped the left camera
      video and the right camera video into the surgeon console, you would not see the stereo display properly.
      With robust sparse stereo, we could shift the left and right view, based on the working distance,
      before piping the videos into the surgeon console for 3D display. Such a 3D display would not be perfect since
      camera view change was not equal to simple shifts in the left and right view. However, surgeons typically
      did not care if it was a imperfect solution as long as it worked for them.
