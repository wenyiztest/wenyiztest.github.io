    <h1>What is Scout</h1>
    <p>Inspired by the tricorder from {\em Star Trek} according to Scandu's founder Walter De Brouwer,
      Scanadu Scout is a bold project aiming to change the status quo in personal healthcare through
      mobile tools beyond thermometer. It went through an Indegigo crowd-funding to validate the
      concept and to fund the product prototype building.

      Scout is a pocket-sized device that, when held to the forehead, was envisioned to measure four physiologic
      parameters: heart rate, blood pressure, body surface temperature and oxygen saturation through pulse
      oximetry. In practice, it is tricky to provide robust, consistent and accurate measurement for parameters such
      as blood measure, by non-professionals at home using a simple multi-functional device.

      It was a unique experience for me to work with the passionate and hard-working people (everyone is an entrepreneur) in
      order to achieve such an inspirational goal. Like many working in a startup, I have been leading the Scout Product Design & Development
      and Managing Contract Manufactures and Supply Chain, personsally developping algorithms focused on sensor fusion & user interaction,
      and preparing Scout patents for IP protection.

    <!-- 2️⃣ Scout Algorithms & Phone Software -->
    <section class="project-section">
      <h2>Scout - Algorithms & Software</h2>
      <p>There are muitple sensors integrated into the small scout device: IR Thermometer, reflective Pulse Oximeter (PPG),
        single-LEAD ECG, 3-axis accelerometer, and MEMS microphone. Naturally you want to utilize all these
        sensors for robust and accurate estimation of key parameters such as respiration rate, blood pressure.

        Cuffless BP (blood pressure) algorithm: One core concept of cuffless BP algorithms is based on pulse transit time  (PTT) or pulse wave transit
        time (PWTT).  Though PTT has been demonstrated to be highly correlated with systolic BP, it is also known that other physiological
        parameters such as age, weight, and height play an important role in converting PTT into BP measurement. For PWTT based BP
        estimation, we utilize timings of the R peak of ECG and maximal change of PPG.

        Scout Data Capture Quality Check: For accurate parameter estimation, Scout needs to collect high-quality data. But allowing
        for Scout to be used by non-professional at home posed a significant challenge. To counter this challenge, we proposed a fusion
        algorithm to utilize all sensors to provide quality feedback to users, for example, No Touch, Hard Touch, Talking Head, and
        Good Data.

        Phone User Interface: Scout utilizes a mobile phone after wirelesss-pairing to provide user interface.

    <!-- 1️⃣ Usability Study -->
    <h2> Published Scout Usability Study</h2>
    <p>
      <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30990860/">Real world usage characteristics of a novel mobile health self-monitoring device:
        Results from the Scanadu Consumer Health Outcomes (SCOUT) Study </a>
      A wide range of personal wireless health-related sensor devices are being developed with
      hope of improving health management. Factors related to effective user engagement, how-
      ever, are not well-known. We sought to identify factors associated with consistent long-term
      use of the Scanadu Scout multi-parameter vital sign monitor among individuals who
      invested in the device through a crowd-funding campaign. Email invitations to join the study
      were sent to 4525 crowd-funding participants from the US. Those completing a baseline sur-
      vey were sent a device with follow-up surveys at 3, 12, and 18 months. Of 3872 participants
      receiving a device, 3473 used it during Week 1, decreasing to 1633 (47 percent) in Week 2.
      Median time from first use of the device to last use was 17 weeks (IQR: 5–51 weeks) and
      median uses per week was 1.0 (IQR: 0.6–2.0). Consistent long-term use (defined as
      remaining in the study at least 26 weeks with at least 3 recordings per week during at least
      80% of weeks) was associated with older age, not having children in the household, and fre-
      quent use of other medical devices. In the subset of participants answering the 12-month
      survey (n = 1222), consistent long-term users were more likely to consider the device easy
      to use and to share results with a healthcare provider. Thirty percent of this subset overall
      reported improved diet or exercise habits and 25 percent considered medication changes in
      response to device results. The study shows that even among investors in a device, fre-
      quency of device usage fell off rapidly. Understanding how to improve the value of informa-
      tion from personal health-related sensors will be critical to their successful implementation
      in care.
