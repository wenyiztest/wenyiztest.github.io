    <h1>What is Active Stereo</h1>
    <p>Active stereo is a technique used in computer vision and depth sensing where two (or more) cameras are
      paired with an active illumination source, such as an infrared (IR) projector. Different from traditional
      passive stereo, the projector projects a known pattern onto the scene, which helps the cameras solve correspondence problems even when the
      environment lacks texture or lighting contrast — yielding more reliable depth maps. Well-known active stereo
      systems include Intel's Real Sense. Compared to ToF (Time-of-Flight) sensors such as Microsft's Kinect 2, active
      stereo cameras also provide good quality images for purposes beyond depth such as object detection and
      tracking.

    <!-- 1️⃣ Active Key Modules -->
    <h2>Building active stereo vision system - from ground up with camera sensors and laser illumination</h2>
    <p>For camera sensor, we choose MT9M021, a 1.2MP, 1/3" global shuter CMOS sensor from Aptive based on its
      excellent pixel performance and small formfactor.</p>


    <h2>Building Camera Module - 3rd Party Partner</h2>
    <p>To built an actual camera module that be integrated into active stereo or another vision systems,
      we worked with Leopard Imaging, a camera module provider that also supports building your own camera modules
      from ground up.</p>

    <h2>VECSEL - choosing the right illuminaton</h2>
    <p>The adoption of VECSEL (Vertical-Cavity Surface-Emitting Laser) into consumer devices is popular today, for
      example, into apple's iPhone for Face ID. Back in 2014-15, after researching I learnd its unique advantages
      including being compact & efficient, uniform & speckle-Reduced IR Projection of high-density patterns. But
      finding a good supplier is a challenge. Fortunately, I was connected to a startup CEO who used to work at
      Sarnoff. He agreed to work with us for potentially being part of an even bigger and exciting Smart Helmet
      project.</p>

      <h2>Active Stereo Vision System Prototype - 3D Printer and Glue</h2>
      <p>To quickly test your idea, you need to protype HW quickly and build SW to run on it.
        With the recent advancement of 3D printers, this becomes fairly easy.</p>

    <!-- 2️⃣ Early Demo of Working Active Stereo -->
    <h2>Early Demos of Active Stereo</h2>
    <p>To trully appreciate the power of VECSEL as effective illumination, we started running active stereo
      indoor with sunlight passing-in and shinning surface. And eventually move outdoors for testing. Suffice to say,
      VECSEL did not disappoint.</p>
