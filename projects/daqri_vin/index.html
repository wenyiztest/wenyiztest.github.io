    <h1>What is VIN</h1>
    <p>VIN is a type of Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) designed for real-time performance and accurate state
      information without loop closure. This makes it perfect for applications such as content rendering for Augmented Reality
      (AR) and real-time positioning in GPS-denied environments, whether it is indoor or outdoor. An optimized VIN system can
      run at video frame rate, typically, 60hz. With an IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) of much higher data rate, typically,
      1000hz, accurate state information can be obtained with minimal latency for AR rendering.

      <h2>Major Components of VIN</h2>
      <p>VIN uses an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) framework to do the state estimation. As
        part of this framework, VIN tracks natural features (Feature Tracking box) in the environment across multiple camera frames while removing outlying features
        (Outlier Rejection box) that do not satisfy certain conditions. The feature correspondences are used to compute the 3D positions of each feature (Triangulation
        box) which serve to constrain the relative camera (or IMU) poses across multiple frames through minimization of the
        reprojection error (EKF-Update box). IMU data is used to further constrain the camera poses by predicting the expected
        camera pose from one frame to the next (EKF-Prediction box). Other major components of the VIN include detecting and
        tracking landmarks in the world (Landmark Recognition box); selecting distinctive camera frames (Keyframe Selection box);
        and augmentation of the EKF state (EKF-Augmentation box).
