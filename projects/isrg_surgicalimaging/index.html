    <h1>What is Computational Surgical Imaging</h1>
    <p>From 1980s to 1990s, typical video endoscopy consists of a stainless shaft with rigid rod lens inside, coupled with a
      camera head with CCD sensors that provide high-quality images. By the late 1990s the CMOS revolution was on its way into
      consumer market, with smaller sensor size, lower power consumption and integration advantage.</p>

      <div class="text">
        By early 2000s, the image quality of CMOS sensor has been singificantly improved to a point, making it possible to replace the bulky
        CCD sensors and hosuings, especially when you need two CCD sensors in a daVinci surgical robot.
        I was very fortunate at that time, witnessing the CMOS revolution, the rise of computational imaging, and leading relevant Applied Research efforts at
        Intuitive Surgical: 1) Spectrum-selected surgical imaging, 2) Single-chip multi-function imaging including Firefly imaging with ICG,
        and 3) High-speed sequential multi-function imaging. These efforts involved researching ideas, building prototypes, working with surgeons,
        showing live demos to stakeholders and executives to help make business decisions, and filing patents.

    <!-- The Evaluation Pipeline  -->
    <h2>Building The Evaluation Pipeline - System Engineering</h2>
    <p>Before I described a few efforts for this project, I wanted to mention this infrastructure effort that is
    critical to make sure all efforts are succesful validated by surgeons. This is the start of my training on spot
    for system engineering out of the need to bridge the huge gap between engineers and surgeons.</p>

    <p>
    To effectively evalute any design and algorithms proposed, I built a pipeline to simulate proposed hardware and evaluate
    algorithms on real surgical videos by surgeons: 1)reference surgical videos were captured in labs by a capture
    system I built based on a) Matrox Orion capture cards, and b) RAID (redudant array of independent disks), in order
    to handle real-time (60fps), synchronous dual-channel (stereo-left and stereo-right), high-quality (1080p) videos,
    2) Synthesize video based on proposed hardware, for example, different CFA designs, 3) Apply algorithms to process
    huge-amount of synthesized video off-line, 4) Pipe the processed videos and original video in real-time to a
    daVinci console for surgeons to view and compare.

    <!-- Spectrum-selected surgical Imaging -->
    <h2>Spectrum-selected Surgical Imaging - Translucent Soft Tissue</h2>
    <p>It was well known that accurate/authentic, color in surgical imaging is critical because it
    allows surgeons to assess tissue oxygenation and viability, which directly impacts patient safety and surgical
    outcomes. <!-- For example, the appearance of a bluish hue, known as cyanosis, indicates the presence of
    deoxygenated hemoglobin in the blood, demanding immediate attention during surgery.</p> -->
    What I did for this project is to explore the speciality of surgical imaging and link it to clinical needs of surgeons.

    <p>
    First, the intra-operative imaging of live soft tissues has its own characteristics compared to everyday life
    imaging of solid objects. That is the translucent soft tissues allows some light to pass through and scatters
    the other as well.  This means that surgical imaging is a volumetric imaging of layers including shallow blood
    vessels below the surface. As a form of ballastic imaging, the Red, Green and Blue light behavied differently when imaging live soft tissue:
    1) Long-wavelenth (around 630nm) Red light has the least scattering and longest penetrating depth, 2)
    Medium-wavelength (around 530nm) Green light has medium scattering and penetration depth.

    <p>
    Second, surgeons pay special attentions to medically meaningful structures like blood vessels. Though below-surface
    blood vessels can be picked up by red and green lights, they behave differently. Green light is strongly absorbed by
    red blood vessels because hemoglobin in blood strongly absorbs wavelengths in the green spectrum. This absorption
    creates a high contrast where blood vessels appear dark against the surrounding tissue, which reflects or scatters
    less green light. On the other hand, red light gets both reflected and scattered by blood
    vessels and surrounding tissues, leading to images with less contrast.
    </p>

    <p>
    As a result, the best spectrum for intro-op surigcal imaging is the Green light, with the best combination of
    penetration depth and image quality (contrast). By applying appropriate techniques, we demonstrated the ability to
    enhance image quality while faithfully preserving accurate color representation. It is worth noting that the following
    simple static image comparison does not fully capture the extent of the improvement. When I demonstrated this live
    with daVinci's stereoscopic video & display to internal stakeholders and the executive team, the response was
    overwhelmingly positive, with feedback such as: "You can see the layers of blood vessels like a 3D network of bridges."

    <!-- Single-chip Multi-function Imaging -->
    <h2>Single-chip multi-function imaging - CFA Design and Demosaicing for Surgical & Firefly imaging</h2>
    <p>Based on the above effort of improving surgical video using the Green-light, and the fact that a white cell
      (not masking out visible spectrum) can increase the sensor sensivity under low-light condition, I proposed
      4-Color CFAs to increased dynamic range and enhance the contrast of critical strucures like blood vessels.

        </figure>
        </div>

      <p>We also proposed Firefly Lite Imaging based on single chip with the standard Bayer CFA design. The idea is to expand the imaging model
         to include additional NIR illumination and then apply simple algebric operations to obtain the Green and NIR (ICG) components. Another approach
         for multi-functional imaging, especially high-quality, high resolution image including Firefly imaging is through high-speed sequential imaging.

    <!-- High-speed Sequential Imaging -->
    <h2>High-speed Sequential Imaging - Multi-functional at Full Resolution</h2>
    <p>I built a prototype sequential imaging system and brought it to labs for experimentation and collecting data.  The feedback from our clinical team is
    quite positive. The system consists of a high-speed Dalsa camera with a mono sensor, and a synchronous sequential illumination provided by a Lumencor Light
    engine. The following mono video of 1k by 1k was captured in a lab at 180hz, while the full-resoluion color video at 60hz was a result of off-line processing.</p>
